## Diagnosing the Problems

The original Air India booking page revealed several key UX/UI issues:

### 1. Visual Hierarchy Issues

- Important details (e.g., flight times, prices, and dates) lacked visual emphasis.
- Users struggled to scan quickly and make decisions efficiently.

### 2. Overwhelming Layout

- The interface felt cluttered due to tight spacing and information overload.
- Cramped UI components made the experience stressful.

### 3. Confusing Navigation

- No visible indicators of the user‚Äôs current step in the booking process.
- Users felt lost during multi-step actions.

### 4. Hidden Filters and Sorting

- Filtering and sorting options were not immediately visible.
- Users couldn't easily refine results, affecting discoverability.

### 5. Ineffective Call-to-Actions

- CTAs like ‚ÄúModify Search‚Äù lacked prominence.
- Users often missed them, leading to friction.

### 6. Low Visibility of Seat Availability and Pricing

- Crucial seat and price info were not well-highlighted.
- Comparisons and booking urgency were difficult to act on.
