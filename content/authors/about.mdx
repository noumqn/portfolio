I am currently a Product Designer at Sea Socials. I completed my Bachelor's in Game and App Development at CMR University, 
where I got placed as a Game Experience Designer Intern at Vincel Studios. Over time, I’ve built a strong foundation in 
design tools such as Unity, Figma, and the Adobe Suite, equipping me to handle a wide range of game and app design needs.
